# May Program - Tan Chui Mui's Love Conquers All

> Love conquers all, but also crushes everything. A cold rain in the tropical foreign land, telling love in an anti-romantic way.
> – Film Selection: Banana Cat (Yiwen Miao)

In this 90-minute film, Malaysian director Tan Chui Mui tells a story about love, choice, and the loss of choice in love. The director's camera focuses on the emotional experiences of the characters, depicting the gazes and inner worlds of women and men in simple scenes. From the first shot, like the weather in Malaysia, you feel the heat, the slowness, the humidity, and the elegance that continues until she steps into love and steps out of it. The rising moisture disappears, like the sound of sandpaper grinding falling to the ground, but the lens remains recorded, wiping away the sound. As a leading figure of the **Malaysian New Wave** movement, director Tan Chui Mui not only illuminates the fragments of life in colored light and shadow but also points her camera at the society of her homeland, projecting thoughts and reflections onto the cinema screen.

The film was released in 2006 and marked the director's feature debut. It received awards including the **New Wave Award** at the 11th Busan International Film Festival, the **International Film Critics' Award**, and the **Golden Tiger Award** at the 36th International Film Festival Rotterdam. The film has been screened at various festivals including the Busan International Film Festival, International Film Festival Rotterdam, Hong Kong International Film Festival, and Vienna International Film Festival. It will also be screened for the first time in Munich:

**Director: Tan Chui Mui**

> At age 5, she nailed together a small stool; at 8, she drove into a pillar; at 9, she created a children's magazine; at 12, she read a complete encyclopedia; at 17, she already had a literary column; at 21, she graduated with a degree in computer animation; at 27, she made 'Love Conquers All'; at 38, she became a mother; at 41, she decided to learn kung fu.

Tan Chui Mui was born in Kuantan, Malaysia, with Chinese roots in Kinmen, Fujian. She graduated from Multimedia University in Malacca with a degree in computer animation. Together with friends, she founded the production company **Da Huang Pictures**. She has worked as a journalist, teacher, director, producer, and actress. She has directed three feature films, including **Love Conquers All**, **Year Without a Summer**, and **Barbarian Invasion**, as well as several short films. Her works cover a wide range of themes from history to science fiction. She excels at depicting delicate emotions and emphasizes female perspectives and social issues. Some of her films, such as **South of South** about Vietnamese Chinese refugees and **Barbarian Invasion** about female self-awareness awakening, highlight social issues. Her style is simple and conveys a grainy atmosphere, with elegant and careful cinematography. Occasionally, her films reveal loneliness and desolation.

This sense of desolation might be related to the situation of Chinese independent cinema in Malaysia. Malaysia has a Chinese population of about 23%, but not all of them have Chinese as their mother tongue. Chinese films therefore do not play a leading role in Malaysia, and the Malaysian government has historically pursued pro-Malay policies. Combined with the influence of foreign films, especially from Hollywood, the development of Chinese independent cinema in Malaysia has not been smooth. Even though the first Malaysian film of 1927, **New Guests**, was a Chinese film, in 2010 the film **Ice Kacang Puppy Love** was subject to a 20% entertainment tax because less than 60% of the dialogue was in Malay. Independent films are often criticized for showing real but not always glorious aspects of society. In **Love Conquers All**, which we will be screening, Tan Chui Mui also shows an imperfect and dark side of society.
