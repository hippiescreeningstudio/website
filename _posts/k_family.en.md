**Synopsis**

Arum’s parents belong to the pivotal generation that led South Korea’s democratization
through the student movements of the 1980s. Eager to pass on a better world to their
daughter, her father chose the path of a public servant, while her mother became a feminist
activist. Inspired by their commitment to building a better Korea, Arum embraced the idea of
becoming a patriotic girl. But at the age of 18, Arum witnessed the Sewol ferry disaster—a
national tragedy that claimed countless lives due to systemic failures. As she uncovered her
father's involvement in the aftermath, Arum began to question the democracy her parents'
generation had fought so ardently to establish. Through the lens of her family’s journey,
Arum delves into the political history of South Korea, grappling with the role her own
generation must assume

**Arum Nam** is a documentary director from Seoul, South Korea, holds a Master's degree in Documentary Filmmaking from the Korea National University of Arts. She directed a short documentary "Pink Femi", which tells the story of a feminist mother, and co-directed "Teleporting" with Japanese directors during the pandemic. "K-family affairs" is her first feature documentary.

**Director's Statement**

Why did I become a passive adult, who couldn't fight injustice like my parents did in their
youth? I even held back from attending protests due to my father's role as a public servant, all
while questioning my failure to emulate my mother's feminism.

"K-family Affairs" is my personal confession, a journey unearthing a long-neglected aspect of
my life. It explores the dilemmas I've faced, which haven't been discussed in a political context
for years. This film is a reflection of my quest to find my own political voice, navigating the
fine line between 'critique' and 'advocacy' for the previous generation. I hope "K-family
Affairs" inspires sharing stories about the next democracy.
