Snow in Midsummer unfolds in Kuala Lumpur on two fateful days: May 13, 1969, and May 13, 2018. In the first, Ah Eng and her mother are torn from her father and brother amid the chaos of political riots. Nearly half a century later, on the same date, Ah Eng looks back on that day, carrying the weight of memory across generations.

The film is a contemporary re-imagining of one of the most famous classical Chinese dramas, in which a young widow curses those who execute her for a crime she did not commit.

Join us for a highly anticipated screening of this award-winning film.
