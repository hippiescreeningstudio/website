Snow in Midsummer is set in Kuala Lumpur at two different periods of time: first on May 13, 1969, and then, on May 13, 2018; it revolves around Ah Eng, a young woman, and her mother who lose contact with the father and brother of the first amid political riots, in the first part, and, in a second chapter, the remembrance of this moment 49 years later.

The film is a contemporary re-imagining of one of the most famous Classical Chinese dramas, in which a young widow curses those who execute her for a crime she did not commit.

Join us for a highly anticipated screening of the award-winning film "Snow in Midsummer 《五月雪》".
