**Synopsis**

At the remarkable age of 92, Coby Yee, a former starlet and owner of the illustrious "Forbidden City Nightclub," reclaimed her place in the spotlight with the senior dance troupe, Grant Avenue Follies. Led by Cynthia Yee, the ensemble brings to life the luminous nightclub era of San Francisco's Chinatown, simultaneously shattering the conventional image of aging Asian women.

Their transnational tour across the US, Cuba, and China unfurls an exploration of diasporic
Chinese entertainment and a profound understanding of their own Chinese American identities. In Havana, their co-performance with local Chinese Opera singers sparked a vibrant renaissance in the city's dwindling Chinese community.

An emotive journey back to her father's homeland in China gave Coby a chance to reflect on
familial memories and observe the startling transformation of urban landscapes.

The film stands as a poignant chronicle of Coby's final journey before her passing at 93,
preserving her indomitable spirit. Meanwhile, the Grant Avenue Follies dance on, carrying the
torch of their shared heritage.

**Q&A with the director**


_What drew you to the stories of Chinese American performers?_

I've always been fascinated by Chinese diaspora communities. While studying photography in London at age 18, I was struck by how Chinese restaurants there felt like time capsules, preserving the China that existed when their owners emigrated. This sparked my interest in people who exist in an "in-between state" between cultures. In 2018, when I received a residency from the Asian Cultural Council to research Chinese American performers, I was particularly interested in Anna May Wong. But I believed there must have been many more women like her whose stories were forgotten.


_How did your first encounter with Coby Yee and the Grant Avenue Follies happen?_

During my research, I discovered a book about Chinatown nightclubs that mentioned an active senior dance troupe. When I reached out to them, they were preparing for a performance at the Burlesque Hall of Fame in Las Vegas. I immediately flew there and saw 92-year-old Coby performing. She was like a butterfly, wearing a self-designed green costume, spinning on stage with incredible grace. The stage lights were still being adjusted, creating this dreamy atmosphere with the music. At that moment, I knew I had to document these women's stories through film.


_Could you talk about the historical context of San Francisco's Chinatown nightclubs?_

From 1882 until the 1950s, due to the Chinese Exclusion Act and racial discrimination, Chinese Americans were largely confined to Chinatowns. Ironically, this segregation led to Chinatown becoming a popular tourist destination, with nightclubs emerging as a unique cultural phenomenon. These venues often had names reflecting "Oriental" themes — Forbidden City, Shanghai Low, Great China — and showcased performers who blended Eastern and Western elements in their acts. The entertainment was shaped by Hollywood's stereotypical portrayals of Asian women, like Anna May Wong's "Dragon Lady" image, but the performers often found creative ways to assert their own identity within these constraints.


_How did your relationship with the dancers evolve during filming?_

What started as a documentary project evolved into something deeply personal. Coby would sometimes forget that I wasn't from her era and would ask me if I remembered certain performers from the old days. During the filming, I became like a member of the dance troupe, with Cynthia becoming my godmother. Even during the pandemic when we couldn't meet in person, we stayed connected through Zoom calls. They participated in major events in my life — my wedding, the birth of my daughter, and supported me through my cancer treatment. They gave me strength when I needed it most.


_What were some of the most memorable moments during the international tour?_

The Cuba trip was particularly special. When I mentioned my previous research in Havana's Chinatown, the dancers became excited about visiting a place they'd only heard about in their parents' stories. We performed in an old theater that had been converted into a martial arts school. Despite language barriers — some speaking Spanish, others English — they found connection through simple Cantonese phrases and shared songs from their childhood. These moments of cultural exchange and connection were exactly what I hoped to capture.


_Your film took an unexpected turn when Coby passed away. How did this affect the project?_

Throughout our two years together, Coby would often mention "swan song" — referring to the legend that swans give their most beautiful performance before dying. She treated every performance as if it might be her last, yet always returned to the stage with incredible vitality. She was still dancing just a week before she passed away in August 2020. A week after her death, I discovered I was pregnant. Coby's daughter cried when she heard the news, saying it represented the cycle of life. This intersection of endings and beginnings became central to the film's narrative.


_Why did you choose to focus on the present rather than delving deeper into historical context?_

If I had made this into an essay film focusing purely on historical issues, the women would have become tools for discussing broader topics. But their vitality, especially Coby's commanding presence, demanded center stage. I wanted to convey that moment of being moved by another life force at a historical turning point. While I maintain my interest in historical and social issues, I'm addressing those through other projects, including an upcoming book. The film preserves many historical threads, including its title — a tribute to pioneering Chinese American women — but six years of internal and external turbulence led me to focus on the emotional core that transcends specific times and places.

_What do you think the relevance of the film is to the current Asian American experience?_

CHINATOWN CHA-CHA explores the lesser-known history of San Francisco's Chinatown nightclub scene while celebrating the resilience of aging Asian American artists who continue to break barriers. It preserves their untold stories and inspires younger generations to honor and continue this rich legacy. In a time of rising anti-Asian violence and threats to Chinatowns, it brings generations together within the AAPI community through film, dance, and dialogue, fostering meaningful discussions on identity, belonging, and activism. We also hope to create spaces for younger AAPIs to learn from and care for their elders.
