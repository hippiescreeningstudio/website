excerpt: "Fang Junrui is a 30-year-old hospital guard who lives in an old tiny flat with his parents in the center of Shanghai. He has been passionate about relic restoration but couldn’t find a related job for years. That has led to his disappointment in life. He routinely buys arts and history books but runs out of space to store them, irritating his parents who own the flat. Things started to change when a friend from the church and the film director came to his life. He felt like that his life was moving again at God’s will."

Fang Junrui, a 30-year-old man, lives with his parents in a cramped Shanghai flat—a space that mirrors his own sense of suffocation under family, societal, and cultural pressures. A passionate relic restorer unable to find work in his field, he drifts through life with growing disappointment. His small apartment fills with art and history books he obsessively collects, sparking constant conflict with his parents. Just as his world seems to close in, an unexpected encounter with a church friend—and the film director—breathes new life into him, guiding him toward faith, purpose, and the possibility of renewal.

NEST is director Qin Xiaoyue's first feature-length documentary. It won the Best Documentary at the 17th FIRST International Film Festival.

_Qin Xiaoyue_ is an independent Chinese documentary filmmaker whose work explores the intimate connections between individuals and society. Her filmmaking journey began on December 21, 2012—the so-called “Mayan doomsday”—when she interviewed strangers on the streets of Shanghai about their regrets and unfulfilled dreams. What started as an experiment in using the camera as a bridge to connect with people soon developed into her debut film Being in the World, a cross-country journey that captured the voices of backpackers, workers, beggars, and everyday citizens across China.

Her first feature-length documentary, Nest, grew out of that early work and took six years to complete. The film won Best Documentary at the 17th FIRST International Film Festival in 2023, establishing her as a distinctive voice in contemporary Chinese documentary cinema.

In 2021, Qin turned her lens toward Hegang, one of China’s cheapest cities, which had become a viral phenomenon as young people disillusioned by urban struggles sought to settle there. The resulting short documentary drew over half a million views online and inspired her ongoing series Living in China, an exploration of migration, belonging, and the search for a meaningful life across the country.

Her second feature documentary For Better or Worse has been selected to the 19th FIRST International Film Festival this year. Qin is currently in production of the documentary series Home Again 6 Living in China and feature documentary Grandma’s Encyclopedia.

**Director's Statement**

This is my first feature-length documentary film. I never thought I would film someone who constantly claims that he is suicidal, which has given me huge pressure that I even had nightmares of him setting a fire on himself while threatening me to film his story. That’s when I paused the project, rethinking my role in documentary filmmaking. I was taking too much on myself, thinking about helping Fang.

However, there is a greater value in his story even if it’s not an ideal “dream-come-true” story. I wanted to explore how an elite family could end up like this. What’s the society’s role in his story? I wish Fang’s story could be a mirror to other families in China and other societies in this world.
