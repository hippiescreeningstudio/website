In September, we will screen another Lou Ye film, _Love and Bruises_.

Lou Ye made Love and Bruises during a five-year, government-imposed ban on filmmaking in China—a fittingly turbulent backdrop for this tale of l’amour fou, set in Paris.

The film is adapted from Naked (裸), a semi-autobiographical novel by Beijing film researcher and teacher Jie Liu-Falin (刘捷). First written in Paris in 2002, the work was reimagined as a screenplay in 2005, then rewritten by Liu and Lou in 2007.

**Synopsis**

Hua, a young teacher from Beijing, has just arrived in Paris. There, she meets Mathieu, a construction worker who falls madly in love with her.

Their relationship is intense—driven by raw sexual attraction, tinged with mistrust, marked by submission, and bound by a mutual dependence that spirals out of control, erasing all boundaries.
